How fast will you travel through Universe using warp drive propulsion?

The formulas used to calculate the time you need to travel are:
  •(497 * 286770) / 86400 -> time to travel from Earth to Proxima Centauri ( the speed of light is 497 seconds per astronomical unit and the distance from Earth to Proxima Centauri is 286770 A.U.. I divided by 86400 to express the final result in days.)
  •(497 * 1680000) / 86400 -> time to travel from Earth to Galactic Center ( the speed of light is 497 seconds per astronomical unit and the distance from Earth to Galactic Center is 1680000 A.U.. I divided by 86400 to express the final result in days.)
  •(497 * 383586) / 86400 -> time to travel from Earth to Barnard's Star ( the speed of light is 497 seconds per astronomical unit and the distance from Earth to Barnard's Star is 383586 A.U.. I divided by 86400 to express the final result in days.)

This application demonstrates how fast you can travel in the Universe using warp drive propulsion.
