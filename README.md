How fast will you travel through Universe using warp drive propulsion?

The formulas that I used to calculate the time you need to travel are:
  •(497 * 286770) / 86400 -> time to travel from Earth to Proxima Centauri ( the speed of light is 497 seconds per astronomical unit and the distance from Earth to Proxima Centauri is 286770 A.U.. I divided by 86400 to express the final result in days.)
  •(497 * 1680000) / 86400 -> time to travel from Earth to Galactic Center ( the speed of light is 497 seconds per astronomical unit and the distance from Earth to Galactic Center is 1680000 A.U.. I divided by 86400 to express the final result in days.)
  •(497 * 383586) / 86400 -> time to travel from Earth to Barnard's Star ( the speed of light is 497 seconds per astronomical unit and the distance from Earth to Barnard's Star is 383586 A.U.. I divided by 86400 to express the final result in days.)

How we did use space agency data in our project?

The information that I found in this link https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html helped me to calculate the distance from Earth to Proxima Centauri. 

Demonstrate the solution.

This application demonstrates how fast you can travel in the Universe using warp drive propulsion.
